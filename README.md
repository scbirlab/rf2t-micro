Predict protein-protein interaction interfaces using deep learning.

**`rf2t-micro`** uses an implementation of [RoseTTAFold](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RoseTTAFold)-2track with streamlined installation, a command-line interface, a Python API, and resilience to out-of-memory error. It takes (paired) multiple-sequence alignments in A3M format (as generated by tools like [`hhblits`](https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite)) as input, and outputs a matrix of inter-residue contacts.

## Installation

Obtaining and setting up `rf2t-micro` is easy.

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/scbirlab/rf2t-micro
```

Using the embedded model requires using the [RoseTTAFold](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RoseTTAFold)-2track weights. These are automatically downloaded, but by using `rf2t-micro` you agree that the trained weights for RoseTTAFold are made available for non-commercial use only under the terms of the [Rosetta-DL Software license](https://files.ipd.uw.edu/pub/RoseTTAFold/Rosetta-DL_LICENSE.txt).


## Usage

You can always get more help by running

```bash
$ rf2t-micro run --help
```

Once you have your (paired) MSA file in A3M format, you can run

```bash
$ rf2t-micro run msa-file.a3m --chain-a-length 224
```

It is required to specify the length of the first protein of the protein pair using the `--chain-a-length` option. If you haven't run the model before, the weights will be downloaded automatically which may take a few minutes.

By default, `rf2t-micro` tries to use GPU acceleration where available. To force only CPU use, use the `--cpu` option.

You can ask for visualisations of the residue interaction matrix by specifying `--plot output-directory`. You can use your own RF-2track parameters with the `--params param-file.npz` option.

## ... if you want larger scale and unpaired MSAs

The `rf2t-micro` package was made primarily to be a lightweight dependency of a portable `pip`-installable protein-protein interaction screening tool called [`yunta`](https://github.com/scbirlab/yunta), which in turn could be used in our [`nf-ggi` Nextflow pipeline](https://github.com/scbirlab/nf-ggi) so that HPC clusters could be conveniently used to screen for protein-protein interactions at scale. 

[`yunta`](https://github.com/scbirlab/yunta) provides a command-line interface and Python API for predicting protein-protein interactions using GPU-accelerated direct coupling analysis (DCA), RoseTTAFold-2track, and structures usign AlphaFold2 from unpaired MSAs.
